# Gym_mobile_application_ui_project
<h1>Overview</h1><br><br>
<h3>Project Background</h3><br>
<p>
  As the location for our endeavor, we picked a gym. For the “New Fitness Center” gym, we intend to build a system. In kottawa, there is a medium-sized gym. There are two consultants and an owner. In this gym, every task is carried out by hand. Up until this point, the new fitness center has used a manual information system that has been successful and efficient for client registration, client payments, providing client schedules, supplying client nutrition programs, client attendance, and the fitness facility itself. At some point. After that efficiency is only one component of success. However, managing both time and data has gotten more challenging. Finding information in urgent situation can be extremely difficult, and information loss is a major concern. After visiting this facility, we were able to observe and comprehend such circumstances. Here, the automatic generation of attendance will be the first system we build for the gym. It can tell whether or not visitors have come to the gym. Here we introduce a QR system.
Additionally, a database complex is developed to enable automatic generation of the client’s data in a database on a computer. When members need information, it may quickly present that information. Additionally, a client payment option has been provided on our mobile application. That is, a mechanism for both cash and online payments has been developed.
New members who join the gym are given a workout schedule based on their fitness level. Here, the BMI of those people is calculated, along with their weight, height, and a determination of whether they are healthy or ill. This technique is set up so that it can identify the dietary requirements of the members and automatically create the necessary nutritional schedules for the relevant parties. Here, we calculate the recommended daily exercise and dietary guidelines for persons of various ages. We have built the technology to automatically identify and carry out the necessary procedures for persons with different conditions.
